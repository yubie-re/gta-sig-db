# GTA 5 Anticheat Signature Database
This contains all past signatures (starting 11/04/2021) added to Grand Theft Auto V's anticheat system. Translations of signature hashes are provided when possible.
This extends the work of my original project [gtav-sigscan](https://github.com/yubie-re/gtav-sigscan).
This workflow automatically checks my private sample repo, and updates the website and json accordingly when new signatures are added to the game.
